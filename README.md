# SOSC Challenge 1 – Hack Your Name

You are given a minimal starter folder.  
Without changing the structure, use **HTML + CSS** to creatively style and animate your **name**.

Add your creativity, colors, shapes, animations, anything you like.

Add your name inside `<h1 id="name">`.

Extra Points:
- Add small JS effects in `script.js`
- Find and fix the hidden bug in the starter files

Submit via GitHub: fork → branch → commit → PR.
